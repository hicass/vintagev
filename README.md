We are a premiere online marketplace for second hand and vintage clothing enthusiasts! Our goal is to become the go-to destination for those seeking sustainable, one of a kind, fashion. Our mission is to promote sustainability and simultaneously celebrating beauty and individuality found in vintage second-hand items.

Our app is designed to connect buyers and sellers, providing a seamless online marketplace for sustainable fashion. With a focus on user-centered design, we have created an intuitive and visually appealing interface that allows users to easily add, delete, or edit their own listings. Leveraging the power of Python, Django, and a PostgreSQL database, Vintage Vault ensures efficient data management and secure access control.
