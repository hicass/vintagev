## IceBox Features
I think for the future, we would like to add on a good amount of features. The search functionality would be a massive feature we would like deploy, our vision is for users to be able to use keywords to look up items, like any other shopping page.We would also like to have our 'likes' and 'shopping bag' page up and fully running for individual users. We would even like to have user profile pages, as well as have a more interractive interface and implement some fun api.
